  * It use `named_pipe` in windows, and `unix_socket` in unix-like system.
  * When install service, it should collect the users info (sid in windows, username in unix) for security.
    * Grant ACL to the pipe (not done)
    * When installing, add user to `nyanpasu` group, and grant the group to the pipe.
* `nyanpasu-service` it the main entrance of the service, it provide a control plane to manage the service, and provide a `rpc` subcommand to test the service.
